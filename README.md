# Climate-Change-Insights-Dashboard
# 🌍 Climate Change Dashboard

This Tableau project visualizes key environmental and meteorological indicators to support climate change monitoring. Built for a global research institution, the dashboard provides real-time insights into temperature trends, air quality, precipitation intensity, and extreme weather events across regions.

## 📊 Project Overview

### 🎯 Business Goals

- Centralize and visualize climate data from multiple regions.
- Provide actionable insights to policymakers and researchers.
- Assess the economic and infrastructure impact of climate conditions.
- Detect and compare monthly variations in environmental factors.

### 🧩 Key Metrics Visualized

- **Average Temperature**
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**
- **Precipitation Intensity**
- **Extreme Weather Events (EWE)**
- **Temperature Variability**
- **Infrastructure Vulnerability Score**
- **Economic Impact Estimates**
- **Population Exposure**

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The climate dataset includes the following dimensions:

- **Metadata**: Record ID, Date
- **Geographic**: Country, City
- **Climate Metrics**: Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Precipitation (mm), AQI
- **Extreme Events**: Types and frequency of weather anomalies
- **Environmental Context**: Climate Zone, Koeppen Classification, Biome Type
- **Meteorological**: Heat Index, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Season
- **Impact**: Population Exposure, Economic Impact, Infrastructure Vulnerability

## ⚙️ Key Tableau Calculations

### Air Quality

- **% Difference AQI**: Month-over-month AQI change.
- **Bad/Good AQI Tags**: ▲ / ▼ visual cues for significant changes.

### Extreme Weather Events

- **% Difference EWE**: Measures month-to-month changes in event count.
- **Good/Bad Indicators**: Symbolic markers for rising or falling severity.

### Temperature & Precipitation

- **% Difference** metrics: Track monthly changes for temperature and rainfall.
- **Temperature Variability**: Uses standard deviation to assess fluctuation intensity.
